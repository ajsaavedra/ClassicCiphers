# ClassicCiphers
This is a brief implementation of Caesar Cipher in Python

Using a simple Caesar cipher implementation, this python code encrypts a message with a given key by taking the ASCII code of each 
character in the message.

In order to decrypt that message, we can either call bruteDecrypt which attempts every single possible decryption by brute force, or
we could give it a keyword in order to break the code.

The message could also obviously be decrypted if the key is known.
